## 21Matches

- This is a simple tkinter game, that you can never win.
  You are given 21 matches and need to pick the last match to win.
  You can only lift 1 or 2 matches at a point of time.

- So, no matter how many you pick the total matches picked in a round is 3.
  This leads to the computer always getting the last match.

### Dependences:
- python
- tkinter
- pillow

### Known Bugs:
- The match picking occurs simultaneously for the user and the computer.
- Crashes on Macos Mojave(due to the default tcl issues that mojave has).

### #TODO: 
- Add option for human v/s human
- Fix match-pick bug
