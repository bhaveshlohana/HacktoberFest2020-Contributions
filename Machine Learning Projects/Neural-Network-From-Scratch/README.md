# Neural-Network-From-Scratch

This program is a complete implementation of a neural networks from scratch made in Python.

**Modules** used for this project are as follows : 
  1. numpy
  2. pandas 
  3. scikit-learn


### Neural_Net_implementation.ipynb

This jupyter notebook contains the whole implementation of our neural networks and all the functions that are needed.
**Activation functions, forward and backward propagation and cost functions** are all implemented.
And this file be used to train any type of data that can be trained on neural networks.
All we need to do is just import the file.

### nn_model.py

This is the some file as the above notebook just in the scirpt form so that we can actually import our functions in another file to train the data and use the features of our neural network

### Breast cancer classification

In this file i have used the **breast cancer dataset from scikit learn module** , that data is already preprocessed and ready to use.
We load the data reshape it so that it can be feed into our neural network in the form of a 1-D array.

In the end with this data our model was able to achieve a **92 percent accuracy**.
