A basic python notebook to demonstrate transfer learning to avoid overfitting.
The model used here is te InceptionV3.

The dataset used here is the Horse vs Humans dataset provided by Laurence Moroney.

This notebook uses the concepts such as :
	Transfer learning
	Image augmentation

We can overcome overfitting using such techniques.

Note: The vaildation accuracy is still very erratic but the final result is acceptable
