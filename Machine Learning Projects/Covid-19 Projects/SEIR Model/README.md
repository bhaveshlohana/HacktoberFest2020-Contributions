# SEIR_Model_Analysis
- Our main aim is to understand the basics of Epidemiology and appreciate its complexity.
- With the help of mathematical modelling and coding we fitted the COVID-19 data into a complicated compartment model SEIR to understand, analyse, estimate as well as forecast currently prevailing Biological phenomena, COVID-19 Epidemic in a more accurate way.
-We used some famous and interesting Notebooks from Kaggle as reference.
