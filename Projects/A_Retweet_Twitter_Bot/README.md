# Hello, World!
### This is a simple retweet bot I made for twitter.

### SETUP
- First of all, you must go to Twitter's API page and request a key. I recommend creating an account just for the BOT.
- Run `npm install` to install all dependencies
- After you get your keys, rename the `example.config.js` to `config.js` and place your keys there (The file is at ./config/ folder).
- Now its time to configure your bot, got to `./bot.js`, and read the commented lines.

### RUN
- To run your bot simply execute `node bot.js`

#### Remember: these keys are confidential do not upload them anywhere.
