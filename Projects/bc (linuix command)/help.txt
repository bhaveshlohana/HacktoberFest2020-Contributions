Basic Operations Have Their Usual Functions
Enter "sinx" for sine of x
Enter "cosx" for cosine of x
Enter "tanx" for tangent of x
Enter "cotx" for cotangent of x
Enter "secx" for secant of x
Enter "cscx" for cosecant of x
Enter "x^y" for x to the power y
Enter "x>y" for x left shift by y digits
Enter "x<y" for x right shift by y digits


		INSTRUCTIONS
The Program Doesnot Store SPACES i.e;
123 45 will be similar to 12345
In Case of subtraction and addition 
	scale will be that of the operand with bigger scale
In multiplication scale will be a.nf + b.nf where
	a.nf is the no. of floats in x	
	b.nf is the no. of floats in y	
In Power function doesnot work for very big numbers
	In "x^y" y should be integer
	it  works when (strlen(x)*y) < 300
	In Power scale is set as a.nf*y where 
	a.nf is the no. of floats in x	
In case of Division The default scale is 0 
	Examle :
		42734/234 = 182
		42734.0/234 = 182.6
		42734.00/234 = 182.62
		42734.000/234 = 182.623
	Or else The scale would be a.nf - b.nf where
	a.nf is the no. of floats in x	
	b.nf is the no. of floats in y	
In case of trignometric functions :
		sin5av3 will be similar as sin5
The dot operator shows the last valid Result
	Sorry You can't perform operation on last result
