# Face-Recognition

I built this using Open CV and Python. Pretty simple and basic program which recognizes faces and displays their name with a rectangle box. 

## Libraries used - 

1. dlib
2. Face Recognition
3. Numpy
4. os
5. cv2

Add your photos in the ImageBasic folder and you are ready to go.
