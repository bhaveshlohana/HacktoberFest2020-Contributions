Ternary Search
==============

Like the binary search, it also separates the lists into sub-lists. This procedure divides
the list into three parts using two intermediate mid values. As the lists are divided into
more subdivisions, so it reduces the time to search a key value. The complexity of Ternary
Search Technique

Complexities
============
Time Complexity: O(log3 n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
