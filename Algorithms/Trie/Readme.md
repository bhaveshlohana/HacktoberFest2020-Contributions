<h1 id="trie-implementation-in-c">Trie Implementation in C</h1>
<p>I implemented a <strong>Trie</strong> in <strong>C</strong>. Its not so much efficent the code is very long.<br>
The file sizes are larger.  Help me to make it more smarter.</p>
<h1 id="acknowledgement">Acknowledgement</h1>
<p>Implemnting a data structure like <strong>Trie</strong> in C is really a <strong>difficult task</strong>.<br>
It requires you to create every function on your own. It unveils the layer of abstraction between the programmer and memory.</p>
<h1 id="fix-me">Fix Me</h1>
<ol>
<li>The code is not portable. If you want to run the code on linux system you have to modify the <strong>makefile</strong> and some functions in the code.</li>
<li>The PrintTrie function does not work on words with spaces.</li>
</ol>
